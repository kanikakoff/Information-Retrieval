# Information Retrieval System

## Overview

This project involves the development of an information retrieval system, focusing on creating and managing indexes to facilitate efficient searching and retrieval of documents. The core functionality revolves around implementing key concepts in information retrieval, including Term Frequency (TF), Inverse Document Frequency (IDF), and various query handling mechanisms. The system is designed to perform accurate relevance scoring and efficiently retrieve documents based on user queries.

## Key Features

- **Index Management**: Constructs and manages an index to efficiently search and retrieve documents.
- **Term Frequency (TF)**: Computes the frequency of terms within documents to assess their importance.
- **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)**: Measures the importance of terms across the entire document corpus, adjusting term relevance.
- **Query Handling**: Supports various query scenarios, including term lookups and relevance scoring based on TF-IDF.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Java

  Java was utilized for its powerful object-oriented programming features, robust libraries for data structures, and effective handling of large-scale data processing tasks.

## How It Works

1. **Index Creation**: Parses documents and builds an index based on term frequencies and document frequencies.
2. **Term Frequency Calculation**: Computes the frequency of terms within individual documents.
3. **Inverse Document Frequency Calculation**: Calculates IDF to determine term importance across the document set.
4. **Query Processing**: Handles user queries by retrieving and ranking documents based on their relevance using the TF-IDF model.

## Real-World Application

This project provides a foundational understanding of information retrieval systems, which are critical in search engines, digital libraries, and data mining applications. By applying TF-IDF and indexing techniques, the system demonstrates how to efficiently manage and retrieve relevant information from large document collections.
