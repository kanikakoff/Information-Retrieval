# DNA Sequence Assembly Project

## Overview

This project focuses on solving the computational problem of reconstructing a DNA sequence from fragmented pieces. By employing various algorithms to handle overlaps and ensure accurate assembly, the project demonstrates the principles of sequence assembly in bioinformatics. The solution is designed to efficiently merge overlapping DNA fragments to form a coherent sequence, handling both common and edge cases in DNA assembly.

## Key Features

- **Fragment Merging**: Implements algorithms to merge overlapping DNA fragments, addressing both complete and partial overlaps.
- **Edge Case Handling**: Robust handling of edge cases, such as overlaps at the boundaries and fragmented sequences with complex overlap patterns.
- **Efficient Processing**: Optimized for performance, ensuring that even large datasets of DNA fragments are processed efficiently.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Java
  
  Java was chosen for its robust object-oriented capabilities, extensive libraries, and cross-platform compatibility, making it ideal for managing complex indexing and retrieval tasks efficiently.

## How It Works

1. **Input Parsing**: Reads and parses DNA fragments from input.
2. **Fragment Merging**: Uses specialized algorithms to merge fragments based on overlapping regions.
3. **Output Generation**: Produces the assembled DNA sequence as output.

## Real-World Application

This project demonstrates crucial concepts in bioinformatics, particularly in DNA sequence assembly, which is fundamental for genetic research, medical diagnostics, and biotechnology applications. The techniques developed here are applicable in various fields where accurate reconstruction of data from fragmented pieces is essential.
